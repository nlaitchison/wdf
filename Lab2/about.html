					<p> Warped Tour is an outdoor music festival that tours around the US and parts of Canada. Around 100 bands are on the tour and play every tour date separated among 7 stages. It originally consisted of pop punk bands, but now has a variety of genres. Besides music, it also focuses on extreme sports, specifically skateboarding. There's a miniramp set up at every tour date. There are also many tents set up for bands, companies and organizations to sell merch. 
					</p>
					<p> Around 1000 kids or more will attend each tour date. The doors normally open at 11am, rain or shine, and it ends around 9pm. Kids line up hours before the festival even starts eager to be the first ones at the stages. Warped Tour is one of the most anticipated events in this genre of music. Since 1995 when it was founded by Kevin Lyman, Warped Tour has always lived up to it's expectations. <br />
