		<h2> <a href="http://fearlessrecords.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">FearlessRecords.com</a> </h2>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Fearless Records is a record company and their site consists of news updates, band information, and videos.

			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Number of errors:
				<ul style=" font-size:14px; ">
					<li> 20 errors in the validator.nu </li>
					<li> HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue because of an error in the HTML </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<!-- <p> The markup has 20 errors in the validator.nu and the HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue because of an error in the HTML. 
			</p> -->
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> A lot of errors occurred because entities weren’t used for the ampersand.  This can be easily fixed by replacing the ampersands with it's entity. The other errors occurred because of missing alt attribute values. All the images have alt=” “, but aren’t given any values. The HTML Lint Validator couldn’t be continued because inline elements, &lt;strong&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;, were used in the values for title attributes. 
			</p>
		
		<h2> <a href="http://purenoise.net/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">PureNoise.net</a> </h2>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Pure Noise Records is also a record company and their site consists of news updates, band information, and videos.
			</p>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Number of errors:
				<ul style=" font-size:14px; ">
					<li> 25 errors in the validator.nu </li>
					<li> HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue because of an error in the HTML </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<!--<p> The markup has 25 errors in the validator.nu and the HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue because of an error in the HTML. 
			</p> -->
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> End tags aren’t in order throughout the page. (ex. &lt;p&gt;&lt;font color="#666666"&gt;No More Than This&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ) So the end tags just need to be flipped around to fix that. This is also the reason why the HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue the validation. None of the images have alt attributes either, so those need to be added to each image. Also, for some elements, spaces are missing in between separate attributes.

		<h2> <a href="http://eyesuckink.com/gallery/index.php" style=" color:#00C78C; ">EyeSuckInk.com</a> </h2>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Eye Suck Ink is a portfolio website for artist Alex Pardee. It’s basically just an image gallery of all his work. 
			</p>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Number of errors:
				<ul style=" font-size:14px; ">
					<li> 1 error in the validator.nu </li>
					<li> 0 errors in the HTML Lint Validator</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<!-- <p> The markup has 1 error in the validator.nu and 0 errors in the HTML Lint Validator. 
			</p> -->
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> One of the images is missing the alt attribute, so screen readers won’t be able to read it. An alt attribute just needs to be added to the img element.

		<h2> <a href="http://www.nineliondesign.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">NineLionDesign.com</a> </h2>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Nine Lion Design is a portfolio website for Chikezie Ejiasi, an interaction designer.
			</p>
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> Number of errors:
				<ul style=" font-size:14px; ">
					<li> 5 errors in validator.nu </li>
					<li> 7 errors in the HTML Lint Validator </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<!-- <p> The markup has 5 errors in validator.nu and 7 errors in the HTML Lint Validator
			</p> -->
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> A majority of the errors are a result of the doctype. It has a HTML5 doctype specified and a transitional HTML 4.01 doctype. Errors that are shown would be okay in HTML5, but because he also specified HTML 4.01, the validator shows them as errors.  The meta tags aren’t closed which is okay in HTML 5, but not for HTML 4.01. There are also HTML 4.01 errors for the closing of image elements.
