		<h1>Validation Check - Lab 2</h1>
		
		<h2><a href="http://fearlessrecords.com/">FearlessRecords.com</a></h2>
		<p> Fearless Records is a record company and their site consists of news updates, band information, and videos. <br />The markup has 20 errors in the validator.nu and the HTML Lint Validator couldn’t continue because of an error in the HTML. <br /> A lot of errors occurred because entities weren’t used for the ampersand.  This can be easily fixed by replacing the ampersands with it's entity. The other errors occurred because of missing alt attribute values. All the images have alt=” “, but aren’t given any values. The HTML Lint Validator couldn’t be continued because inline elements, &lt;strong&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;, were used in the values for title attributes.
