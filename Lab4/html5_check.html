			<p> Post Mates is a same day urban logistics & delivery platform.</p>
			<p> They used all their HTML5 elements correctly, but left out the &lt;nav&gt; element. They just put a &lt;ul&gt; inside of the &lt;header&gt;. They do only have 3 nav options though. Some of the headers are also missing, but they're not actually needed in the site. Other than that the footer, header and sections are used correctly.</p>
		
		<h2> <a href="http://creative9.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">Creative9.com</a> </h2>
			<div> <img src="images/creative9.jpg" /> </div>
			<p> Creative9 is development and interactive design agency based in the UK.</p>
			<p> The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; elements are used properly, but the sections aren't outlined properly. This is mainly because of the use of &lt;hgroup&gt;. Only the first header of the group shows up in the outline. The rest of the untitled &lt;section&gt;'s are a result of the the content they contain. The &lt;section&gt;'s are used to separate or group the content, but not all of it requires it's own heading. They contain information and images that directly relate to the &lt;h1&gt; element. They could be placed into div's instead of sections.

			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> All of their HTML5 elements, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt etc., are used correctly. The only untitled section of the page is the navigation which is okay.

			<p> A majority of the errors are a result of the doctype. It has a HTML5 doctype specified and a transitional HTML 4.01 doctype. Errors that are shown would be okay in HTML5, but because he also specified HTML 4.01, the validator shows them as errors.  The meta tags aren’t closed which is okay in HTML 5, but not for HTML 4.01. There are also HTML 4.01 errors for the closing of image elements.
