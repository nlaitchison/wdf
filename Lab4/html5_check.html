		<h2> <a href="http://postmates.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">PostMates.com</a> </h2>

			<p> Post Mates is a same day urban logistics & delivery platform.</p>
			<p> They used all their HTML5 elements correctly, but left out the &lt;nav&gt; element. They just put a &lt;ul&gt; inside of the &lt;header&gt;. They do only have 3 nav options though. Some of the headers are also missing, but they're not actually needed in the site. Other than that the footer, header and sections are used correctly.</p>
		
		<h2> <a href="http://creative9.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">Creative9.com</a> </h2>
			<div> <img src="images/creative9.jpg" /> </div>
			<p> Creative9 is development and interactive design agency based in the UK.</p>
			<p> The &lt;header&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; elements are used properly, but the sections aren't outlined properly. This is mainly because of the use of &lt;hgroup&gt;. Only the first header of the group shows up in the outline. The rest of the untitled &lt;section&gt;'s are a result of the the content they contain. The &lt;section&gt;'s are used to separate or group the content, but not all of it requires it's own heading. They contain information and images that directly relate to the &lt;h1&gt; element. They could be placed into div's instead of sections.

			<p> Loaf Creative is a digital, design and social media company.	
			<p style=" font-size:14px; "> All of their HTML5 elements, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt etc., are used correctly. The only untitled section of the page is the navigation which is okay.

		<h2> <a href="http://www.nomineedesign.com/" style=" color:#00C78C; ">NomineeDesign.com</a> </h2>
			<div> <img src="images/nominee.jpg" /> </div>
			<p> Nominee Design is a branding, design and web agency from Oklahoma.
			</p>
			<p> The HTML5 elements are used properly throughout the site. The online sections that don't contain titles are the &lt;nav&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;. Neither of these elements require headers though, so there are no issues to fix.
