					<p> Warped Tour is a pretty crazy musical festival and if it's your first time attending, you might not know what to do with yourself. <strong>This is your guide.</strong> <br />

				<h3 id="#2"> Preparing for Warped </h3>
					<ol>
						<li> <strong> Pre-order your tickets. </strong> <br />
						This will save you at least &#36;15. <br />
						<a href=" "> Purchase Tickets</a> </li>
						<li> <strong> Look up the location. </strong> <br />
						Know how to get there, where there's parking, etc. </li>
						<li> <strong> Make a list of bands. </strong> <br />
						Check the official Warped Tour site and make a list of bands you plan to see on tour in order of importance to you. There can be up to 100 bands. You don't want to miss your favorite.<br />
						<a href=" "> View Bands </a></li>
						<li> <strong> Have a lot of cash. </strong> <br /> 
						You'll need to have cash for parking. You're going to need to drink water which is normally around &#36;4 a bottle. (No one wants to end up in the hospital.) You also need money for food. Lastly, you'll most likely want to buy band merch, lot's of it.</li>
						<li> <strong> Watch the weather. </strong> <br />
						Since Warped is outdoors, the weather is extremely important. Dress accordingly.</li>
						<li> <strong> Get there early. </strong> <br />
						There can be more than a thousand kids at Warped and you don't want to be last inline. Doors open at 11am and some kids might already be inline at 6am if not earlier.</li>
