				<h3 id="prep"> Preparing for Warped </h3>
					<ol>
						<li> <strong> Pre-order your tickets. </strong> <br />
						This will save you at least &#36;15. <br />
						<a href="http://www.vanswarpedtour.com/dates/index"> Purchase Tickets</a> </li>
						<li> <strong> Look up the location. </strong> <br />
						Know how to get there, where there's parking, etc. </li>
						<li> <strong> Make a list of bands. </strong> <br />
						Check the official Warped Tour site and make a list of bands you plan to see on tour in order of importance to you. There can be up to 100 bands. You don't want to miss your favorite.<br />
						<a href="http://www.vanswarpedtour.com/bands/index"> View Bands </a></li>
						<li> <strong> Have a lot of cash. </strong> <br /> 
						You'll need to have cash for parking. You're going to need to drink water which is normally around &#36;4 a bottle. (No one wants to end up in the hospital.) You also need money for food. Lastly, you'll most likely want to buy band merch, lot's of it.</li>
						<li> <strong> Watch the weather. </strong> <br />
						Since Warped is outdoors, the weather is extremely important. Dress accordingly.</li>
						<li> <strong> Get there early. </strong> <br />
						There can be more than a thousand kids at Warped and you don't want to be last inline. Doors open at 11am and some kids might already be inline at 6am if not earlier.</li>
					</ol>
				<h3 id="enjoy"> Enjoying Warped </h3>
					<ul>
						<li> <strong> Make friends.</strong> <br />
						You'll be inline for quite a while, so why not make some friends while you're there? </li>
						<li> <strong> Find the performance schedule. </strong> <br />
						As soon as your in the venue, find the big inflatable performance board. This has the set times and stages for every band, get out your list from earlier and write down the corresponding time and stage. </li>
						<li> <strong> Watch the time. </strong> <br /> 
						You don't want to end up missing your favorite band, so make sure you're checking the time! </li>
						<li> <strong> Explore the venue. </strong> <br />
						 You'll most likely have time to explore between sets. So find out where you favorite bands' merch tents are and check out their stuff. Most bands will also have a time displayed for signings at their tent. You probably don't want to miss those either.</li>
						<li> <strong> Drink water, eat food. </strong> <br /> 
						 It's easy to get dehydrated out in the heat, so make sure your drinking water and eating. This is the best day of your year, you don't want to ruin it by ending up in a hospital. </li>
						<li> <strong> Buy merch. </strong> <br /> 
						A lot of the merch at Warped is unavailable anywhere else. You don't want to miss out on some awesome stuff, I promise you'll regret it. Plus, it's all memories.  </li> 
						<li> <strong> Get crazy, have fun. </strong> <br /> 
						Don't worry about what other people think, just have fun. This is an amazing day where you get to be yourself and listen to awesome music. Don't let anyone take that away from you. </li>
